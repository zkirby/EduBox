# EduBox
I've conceived this idea after reading an article on the Education crisis with regards to Syrian Refugees (https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/society/2016/9/7/syrias-education-crisis-2-7-million-children-out-of-school).
I thought that with the release of such technologies as the $5 Rasberry Pi, it wouldn't be hard to invent a system of rules, procedures, and curriculums that could solve this crisis with technology. 

# About
This is essentially the corner stone of that idea: a small light weight application with an interactive GUI that can be put on cheap Rasberry Pi's and shiped around the world so children can learn outside of classrooms. 

# Features 
The current work features an interactive GUI with a text editor and math, english, statistics, physics, and history modules, each with unique features. Some of the highlights are a derivitive calculator, definition web scraper, and a graphing system. The framework for a file system was built but never implemented.

# How it works.
The GUI is built in GTK+3, but other modules such as Sympy, xml, and Tkinter were all used to implement the modules.
